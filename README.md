Simple Linear Regression Practice
This repository showcases my journey in learning and practicing Simple Linear Regression through a project predicting height based on weight.

Project Overview:
Objective: Predict an individual's height using their weight as the input feature.
Dataset: Used a dataset containing weight and height values for multiple individuals.
Approach:
Analyzed the relationship between weight (independent variable) and height (dependent variable).
Built a regression model using the formula 
𝑌=𝑚𝑋+𝑏
Y=mX+b, where 

Y is height, 

X is weight, 

m is the slope, and 

b is the intercept.
Key Concepts Learned:

Understanding Relationships: Identified the correlation between weight and height.

Mathematical Modeling: Created and interpreted the regression equation.

Data Visualization: Visualized data with scatter plots and regression lines to better understand trends.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.

Implementation: Practiced coding in Python with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

This project represents my first step in applying machine learning concepts to solve real-world problems.
